### Technologies Used

- **React:** Employs React, a powerful JavaScript library, to create a dynamic and interactive user interface.
- **Redux:** Utilizes Redux for effective state management, ensuring a centralized and predictable data flow in the application.
- **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:** Leverages the foundational technologies of the web to build a robust and responsive frontend.
- **Chakra-UI:** Integrates Chakra-UI, a modular and accessible component library for React, to facilitate the development of stylish and user-friendly interfaces.
- **Chart.js:** Incorporates Chart.js, a versatile JavaScript charting library, to create visually appealing and interactive charts for data representation.

### Getting Started

#### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed on your machine:

- Node.js: [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
